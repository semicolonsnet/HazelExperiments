================

Some experimental rules I've created for my own purposes to use with Hazel (OS X). Use at your own risk.

NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, sets containing multiple rules should be kept in the order which they're presented.

**Contents**

Geotag Pictures - Designed to be run on a root Pictures folder. Uses geotagged information (where available) to assign photos a Mavericks tag based on their location (generally, city and state). Requires [Location Helper for Applescript ](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html). Thanks to [JakeBilbrey](https://github.com/JakeBilbrey) for help with Location Helper.

IFTTT Date Rename - Processes dates from files saved to dropbox by [If This Then That](http://ifttt.com) into machine-sortable format (2003-01-02_04-05-06).

Manage Photo Booth Rules - Move Photo Booth pictures out of their bundle and organizes them with regular photos by year and month.

Recursive Backup - Designed for applications which keep backup files in a single directory but do not delete old backups. This rule set keeps i) All backups in the last two weeks; ii) One backup for each month this year, sorted in directories, and; iii) No backups older than a year.

OCR Screenshots with PDFpen - Watches a folder for new screenshots and runs them through PDFpen's OCR to set the Spotlight Comment with the text in the screenshot. This makes searching for that one screenshot easier.
